Domain Knowledge:

The game is played by both players simoultaniusly. That means that we can ignore the enemy moves, and solely focus on our own.
since they will not happen at the same time, or have a turn shift. The game will be played more on a high score basis than a turn to turn basis.


We have decided to assign our datas into blocks, that we combine to represent a game.
